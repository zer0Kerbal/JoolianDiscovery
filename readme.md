# Joolian Discovery

Parts pack for Kerbal Space Program

## by Ed T. Toton III, aka NecroBones and zer0Kerbal


### Installation:

Simply copy the "JoolianDiscovery" folder into your GameData folder. If upgrading from a 
previous version, be sure to delete the old one from GameData first (this is the cleanest
option).

### Information:

This parts pack is inspired by the USS Discovery One ship, from the 2001: A Space Odyssey
feature film. It is not meant to be an exact replica, nor is it constructed to scale. 
However, it's meant to be highly reminiscent of that ship, with the correct general overall
shape and proportions. After searching for similar models made by other KSP modders, and
finding that little had been done, I decided that it fell to me to fill the void. :)


We hope you enjoy this pack. If you have any comments or feedback, please feel free to
send a private message to NecroBones on the KSP forums. Thanks!
