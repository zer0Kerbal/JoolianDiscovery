<h3 id="information">Information:</h3>
<p>This parts pack is inspired by the USS Discovery One ship, from the 2001: A Space Odyssey feature film. It is not meant to be an exact replica, nor is it constructed to scale. However, it's meant to be highly reminiscent of that ship, with the correct general overall shape and proportions. After searching for similar models made by other KSP modders, and finding that little had been done, I decided that it fell to me to fill the void. :)</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this pack. If you have any comments or feedback, please feel free to send a private message to NecroBones on the KSP forums. Thanks!</p>
